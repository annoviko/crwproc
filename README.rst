crwproc
=======

**crwproc** is a tool to work with a process memory in Windows OS. 

One of the motivations for this project was the fact that I could not use CheatEngine and ArtMoney, but I needed to search for preambulas and specific values and then update them.

Essentially, the application provides almost the same basic functionality like CheatEngine and ArtMoney to operate with memory. BUT it does not provide functionality to run scripts and ASM injections like CheatEngine. If you are in the same situation like me, then you can use this application, otherwise I would recommend to use CheatEngine instead since it has huge support and community.


Technical Details
=================

The application is written using pure C++ and WinAPI.

The application has been tested on Win 10 x64.
